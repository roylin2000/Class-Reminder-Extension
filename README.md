# Class-Reminder-Extension
This is a Chrome Extension that aims to keep students on track for online courses, espcially for courses where the professor does not record the lectures D:

The extension allows the user to input their name/code of their courses, time and day of their courses, and the links to their courses (e.g CSC108, 8pm, Monday, zoom.com/abcd).
When your class starts, the extension will drop a friendly popup on the page you are currently on and provides you the link to your class!

# TO-DO
- Need to allow the user to configure and delete old or incorrect courses
- Allow users to also keep track of tests and assigments!
